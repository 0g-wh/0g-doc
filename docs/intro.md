# Introduction to 0G

## 0G: Democratized AI Operating System

0G is the blockchain designed specifically for AI with an infinitely scalable data availability (DA) layer, modular storage system, and a flexible serving framework. As the only chain capable of managing vast data volumes, 0G bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3, turning the once-impossible use cases into reality.

**The Challenge Today**: Web3 lacks the infrastructure needed to support data-intensive applications like AI, high-frequency trading, and fully on-chain gaming. These applications, along with countless others, represent a multi-trillion dollar opportunity that current data availability layers (DALs) can't fully support. 
DALs provide an efficient yet secure manner to publish data and to keep it available for anyone to verify. For example, Layer 2 rollups publish data that must be kept available, proving that the off-chain transactions were executed correctly. While existing DALs have been instrumental for Layer 2s, they haven't been robust enough for broader use cases.

**Enter 0G**: 0G sets a new standard, achieving 50gbps per consensus layer at just $5/TB per month. This makes it 50,000x faster and 100x more cost-effective than current solutions, finally bringing Web3 to performance and cost parity with Web2 and enabling use cases that were previously impossible, possible. 

**How Does 0G Achieve This?** At its core, 0G’s system allows for direct interaction between the data availability layer and the decentralized storage system. The integrity of this system is maintained by 0G’s consensus network, which can support an arbitrary number of independent consensus networks. As network requirements increase, new consensus networks can be added to support horizontal scalability and increase the system’s overall bandwidth and performance. By decoupling data publication from data storage, 0G optimizes both throughput and scalability, overcoming the limitations seen in existing DA solutions.

On Newton Testnet, we’ve demonstrated that each node can achieve 10mbps. With 5,000 nodes, that’s 50,000mbps or 50gbps per consensus layer, meaning the bottleneck then becomes the consensus layer. Our future plans include implementing our own custom consensus layer, akin to adding more AWS servers in a Web2 context, to enable infinite throughput with an arbitrary number of consensus layers.

## 0G Ecosystem: Powering the Decentralized AGI Future
0G is more than just a blockchain—it's a democratized AI operating system composed of four core components: 
- **0G Chain**: The fastest, most modular blockchain, making on-chain gaming and AI a reality.
- **0G Storage**: A distributed storage network optimized for massive data loads.
- **0G DA**: An infinitely scalable and programmable data availability layer designed for end-users.
- **0G Serving**: A versatile framework for data retrieval, AI inference, and model training.

“0G” gets its name from “Zero Gravity,” which is exactly what we aim to achieve – a state of weightlessness where transactions and data exchanges can occur effortlessly. Our mission is “To Make AI a Public Good,” with every part of our ecosystem contributing to this vision.

## Use Cases Unlocked with 0G 
0G’s technology unlocks a range of previously infeasible use cases, including:
- Fully on-chain gaming with storage of game assets, characters, maps
- On-chain AI, including training large language models (LLMs)
- Storage of entire AI agent networks on-chain
- Storage of large datasets for data cleaning and labeling
- High frequency trading at TPS of
- Micropayments and streaming platform payments
And much more.
