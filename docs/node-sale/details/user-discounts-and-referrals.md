# User Discounts And Referrals

### How do node buyers create their own referral code?
It is their wallet address. Anyone who purchases a node can refer someone else by passing them their wallet address to use as a code.

### I am using a referral code for the Node Sale. What discounts do I get?

    Every buyer can have their own referral code. The wallet address you use during the node sale is your personal referral code. Users can share their wallet addresses as referral codes with other potential buyers.

### What benefit do users get for successful referrals?
Users with successful referrals (users used your code to purchase a node) will receive a 5% cashback.

### How will I receive my commission? (For Referrers) 
The commission you will receive is based on the total node purchase amount sold via your referral code in USDC. After the team has verified your Alignment Node purchase(s), you will be airdropped your USDC amount to the wallet address of the registered referral code.
