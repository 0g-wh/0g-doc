# User Discounts And Referrals

### How do node buyers create their own referral code?
It is their wallet address. Anyone who purchases a node can refer someone else by passing them their wallet address to use as a code.

### I am using a referral code for the Node Sale. What discounts do I get?

### What benefit do users get for successful referrals?
Users with successful referrals (users used your code to purchase a node) will receive a 5% cashback.

### How will I receive my commission? (For Referrers) 
The commission you will receive is based on the total sales amount sold via your referral code in USDC. After the team has verified your Alignment Node purchase(s), you can receive your USDC amount to the wallet address of the registered referral code.
