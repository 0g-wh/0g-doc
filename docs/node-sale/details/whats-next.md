# What happens after you purchase a node?
## What's Next?

After purchasing an 0G Alignment node node, holders will receive an ERC-721 NFT to the wallet addresses used during the node sale. The NFT contains the license and terms of ownership of the purchased 0g node and participation in the 0G community.

You can purchase as many nodes as you want, if available based on the cap limitations. The Alignment Node license gives buyers lifetime access. The NFTs will be non-transferable for the first year after the node sale.

The NFTs will be transferred to buyer wallets directly at a later date. There's no claiming process. There will be sufficient time between sending the NFT and time for users to download, install, and run their nodes to start earning rewards. The alignment node will start being put into use after the mainnet goes live, projected to be launched in Q1 2025.
