### What is the whitelist (WL)?
Whitelist is a pre-approved list of participants who are given exclusive access to certain privileges during a sale event. This system is used to reward and incentivize key contributors, partners, or early supporters of a project.

### Does entering the whitelist guarantee that I can definitely purchase a node?
Your whitelist guarantees an allocation during the Whitelist sale period (11/11 - 13/11). Your allocation will be released if purchase is not made within this period.

### How to join the whitelist?
To get a whitelist spot for the 0G Foundation Node Sale, community members and ecosystem participants are eligible for allocations, please visit 0G X and Discord for ways to receive a whitelist. You can also apply for a whitelist spot by filling out the whitelist form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZSiIn3WBEdztzCObFBnLa0c6f1YoRwlN_eI8NxGPuG4w-zg/viewform).
