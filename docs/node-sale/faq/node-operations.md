### What are the hardware requirements?
0G Foundation’s AI Alignment nodes are designed for adoption - they can be run on community members’ laptops, desktops, mobiles, or even on cloud instances.

As for device requirements, the configuration needed is very minimal: 
- 64MB RAM
- 1 X86 CPU Cores@2.1GHz
- 10GB Disk Space
- 10Mbps Internet Connection

### When can I begin operating my node?
Light utility is estimated to go live Q1 2025. AI Alignment utility will go live in 2025, after 0G Mainnet Launch.

### How many nodes can I purchase?
The number of purchasable nodes will be capped per tier. Please refer to the Node Sale Tier documentation for reference.

### How do I run a node? Is it complicated?
Running a node can be quite straightforward and easy, typically involving just a few steps. We will soon provide a video tutorial to guide you through the process. If you prefer not to manage the node yourself, you can delegate to other node operators with just a single click through our explorer, which will be available shortly.

### Will the sale be accessible from other platforms?
All public and Whitelist sale cards will be available on [https://node.0g.ai](https://0g.ai/node-sale) except for Partnered Launchpads like Impossible Finance, in which case the front end will be on 0G Partners' website.
