### What are the hardware requirements?
0G Foundation’s AI Alignment nodes are designed for adoption - they can be run on community members’ laptops, desktops, mobiles, or even on cloud instances.

As for device requirements, the configuration needed is very minimal: 
- 64MB RAM
- 1 X86 CPU Cores@2.1GHz
- 10GB Disk Space
- 10Mbps Internet Connection

### When can I begin operating my node?
AI Alignment utility will go live in 2025, after 0G Mainnet Launch.

### How many nodes can I purchase?
The number of purchasable nodes will be capped per tier. Please refer to the Node Sale Tier documentation for reference.

### How do I run a node? Is it complicated?
Running a node can be quite straightforward and easy, typically involving just a few steps. We will soon provide a video tutorial to guide you through the process. If you prefer not to manage the node yourself, you can delegate to other node operators with just a single click through our explorer, which will be available shortly.

### Will the sale be accessible from other platforms?
Both Public and Whitelist sale will be available soon (Link TBU) except for Partnered Launchpads, in which case the front end will be on 0G Partners' website.
