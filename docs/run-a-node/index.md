# Run a Node
---

Zero Gravity (OG) is currently live on [Testnet-V2](docs/run-a-node/testnet-information), with Mainnet coming soon. The networks support various node types, each node playing a crucial role in maintaining and securing the network. 

In this section, explore the different types of nodes you can run and learn about its specific role and how it contributes to the overall network functionality.

By understanding and potentially operating these different node types, you'll gain valuable insights into our network's architecture and contribute to its robustness and efficiency. 

If you are interested in _using_ a node instead, dive into our SDK section [here.](docs/build-with-0g/sdk.md)
