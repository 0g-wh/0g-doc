# Automated Updates with Cosmovisor 

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps to transition from using `0gchaind start [flags]` to leveraging Cosmovisor for managing your 0gchaind application. Cosmovisor offers the significant advantage of automating upgrades, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

## Migration Steps

1. **Stop the Current 0gchaind Instance:** Ensure the currently running 0gchaind process is stopped before proceeding with the migration.

2. **Download the Migration Script:** Obtain the migration script from the following URL:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0glabs/0g-chain/dev/networks/testnet/init-cosmovisor.sh

   OR

   Install Cosmovisor:
   ```bash
   go install cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@latest
   ```

   Set up Cosmovisor:
   ```bash
   export DAEMON_NAME=0gchaind
   echo "export DAEMON_NAME=0gchaind" >> ~/.profile
   export DAEMON_HOME=$1
   echo "export DAEMON_HOME=$1" >> ~/.profile
   cosmovisor init $(whereis -b 0gchaind | awk '{print $2}')
   mkdir $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/backup
   echo "export DAEMON_DATA_BACKUP_DIR=$DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/backup" >> ~/.profile
   echo "export DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true" >> ~/.profile
   ```

3. **Verify the 0gchaind Path:** Utilize the `whereis 0gchaind` command to confirm the path of your 0gchaind binary. If the path returned by `whereis 0gchaind` differs from the one currently used to run 0gchaind, modify the script accordingly. Open the script and replace the 0gchaind path with the correct one.

4. **Execute the Migration Script:**
   * Make the script executable: `chmod +x init-cosmovisor.sh`
   * Run the script: `./init-cosmovisor.sh (0G_HOME)`

5. **Start 0gchaind with Cosmovisor:** Initiate 0gchaind using Cosmovisor: `cosmovisor run start [flags]`

## Troubleshooting

Should you encounter any issues, execute the following command to examine the Cosmovisor configuration: `cosmovisor config`. This command will display the current configuration settings, aiding in identifying and resolving potential problems.
