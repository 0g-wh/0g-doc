# Testnet Information

In Testnet-V2, you have the opportunity to operate various node types, including Validator, Storage, and DA (Data Availability) nodes. Detailed guides on how to run each of these node types are provided below.

### Key Features

1. **Objective Validator Selection**: We've implemented a fair and transparent process for selecting validators, which is essential for maintaining network integrity.

2. **Performance Monitoring**: A sophisticated monitoring service helps us track performance and optimize the network.

3. **Limited Validator Slots**: Due to Cosmos limitations, we can only select 125 validators at a time.

4. **Rotation System**: Validators are rotated every two weeks, though this period may occasionally be longer.

### Important Notes

- The validator selection process described here applies **only to the testnet**. The mainnet will have a different selection mechanism.
- Your chances of being selected as a validator increase if you run multiple node types. However, it's also possible to run nodes independently.

### Application Process

While we receive numerous validator applications, the limited slots mean not all applicants can be accommodated immediately. We appreciate your patience and continued interest in contributing to our network.

For detailed instructions on how to apply and operate each node type, please refer to our comprehensive setup guides.
