## Why Decentralized AI?

AI is growing exponentially and is expected to become an $826B industry by 2030. The advent of large language models (LLMs) and parallel computing hardware (GPUs, TPUs, and NPUs) has significantly accelerated the progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). This revolution is reshaping business models, automating processes, and transforming how we search for information. 

However, today's AI infrastructure is highly centralized, dominated by a few entities controlling the data and algorithms, resulting in significant issues: 

* **Privacy Concerns**: Centralized platforms often misuse personal data, leading to data breaches and exploitation of personal information.
* **Fairness & Accountability**: Opaque decision-making processes within centralized AI systems makes it challenging to ensure fairness and accountability.
* **Alignment Challenges**: Ensuring that AI systems align with human values and intentions increases the risk of bias and misalignment with human values, as a few organizations may monopolize AI development.

This has fueled growing demands for transparency and decentralization in AI, which offers a fairer distribution of value and full transparency to an otherwise opaque industry: 

* **Enhanced Privacy**: Users retain control over their data, deciding how and when it's used. 
* **Fairness & Transparency**: Decentralization allows open scrutiny of AI algorithms, reducing bias and ensuring that every stage of AI development can be tracked and audited. 
* **Democratization**: Decentralized platforms like 0G empower broader communities to contribute to AI development, fostering inclusivity and innovation.

## Problems with Crypto x AI today

But decentralizing AI is no small feat. AI workflows are inherently complex, involving enormous data processing and neural network computations, resulting in massive increases in power consumption. Replicating this workflow in a decentralized environment is non-trivial. It requires well-designed abstraction and incredibly scalable infrastructure that can handle the demands of AI workloads while maintaining the benefits of decentralization. 

Today's blockchain infrastructure falls short in meeting the needs of real-world AI applications due to limited throughput: Ethereum processes 10-20 TPS, Solana less than 4,000 TPS, and Layer 2s less than 400 TPS. This equates to data throughput of approximately 1.5 mbps on average, which is 33,333x lower than the 50 gbps that's needed to fuel AI applications. Large-scale models like Open AI's GPT-4 require even more throughput as they must handle massive amounts of data and interactions. 

**Zero Gravity (0G)** is addressing these challenges by providing a decentralized AI operating system (dAIOS) with a modular and layered architecture design.

## Introducing 0G

A dAIOS like 0G is an operating system designed to manage decentralized hardware resources for AI applications, providing solutions to the key problems in centralized AI:

* **Data Ownership & Control:** Users gain more control over their data, mitigating the risk of misuse or unauthorized access.
* **Transparency & Auditability:** Every stage of the AI lifecycle is transparent, allowing for tracking, auditing, and verification.
* **Fairness & Alignment:** Decentralization facilitates the alignment of AI systems with diverse values, minimizing bias or control by a single entity.

Decentralization ensures transparency in data provenance (where the data comes from), model attribution (who owns or has contributed to the data and models), and alignment with human values (ensure that AI systems act in accordance with human values and intentions). 

0G's decentralized AI operating system (dAIOS) offers the foundation to build a fairer, more open AI ecosystem, where power is distributed and innovation thrives. In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into how 0G enables this vision and what it means for the future of AI.
