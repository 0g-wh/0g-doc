# Preface

Advanced problem-solving and decision-making are now accessible at scale. There is a new wave of “intelligence”: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). 

The advent of [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/) and parallel computing hardware (GPUs, TPUs, and NPUs) has significantly accelerated progress toward [artificial general intelligence (AGI)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/artificial-general-intelligence-AGI). AGI is poised to contribute [trillions](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights) to the global economy annually and transform industries by driving the marginal cost of intelligence toward zero. 

But there are consequences to the race to AGI. 

Today’s AI infrastructure is highly centralized, dominated by a few entities controlling the data and algorithms, resulting in significant issues. These issues can be addressed by blockchains like Zero Gravity (0G) to create a more [decentralized AI](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2023/10/consumers-are-voicing-concerns-about-ai): 

- **Ownership**: Centralized AI platforms often sell or misuse personal data, with users having little control or ownership over how their information is collected, stored, or used. _Blockchain technology empowers users to retain control over their data, deciding how and when it’s used._

  **With 0G, users can store and manage data on-chain through decentralized storage networks, retaining full ownership and control.**
  
- **Transparency & Accountability**: Centralized AI systems operate as black boxes, with opaque decision-making processes and no clear data provenance. Users who provide training data rarely receive adequate rewards for their contributions, and the system lacks transparency in how value is distributed. _Decentralized AI fosters transparency by providing open, auditable decision-making processes and verifiable data sources, ensuring accountability at every step._

  0G’s modular architecture enables transparent data availability and verifiable AI models, making every decision and data source traceable.
  
- **Monetization**: Centralized AI systems often monopolize profits and leave little incentive for individual contributors. _Blockchain enables the issuance of rewards to incentivize participation and subsequently distribute rewards in a fair and transparent manner._ 
 
  **Users of 0G’s storage, data availability, or serving platforms pay a small fee for these services, and these rewards are then distributed to the nodes.** 
  
- **Alignment Challenges**: Centralized AI systems lack oversight and governance processes. A select group may have the authority to censor or promote material, leading to misalignment with human values. _Decentralized AI platforms promote collective governance and oversight by increasing access to AI development, fostering inclusivity and innovation by a broader community rather than a single entity._ 

  **0G provides access to lower-cost compute resources, lowering the high cost barrier to entry for inference, fine-tuning, and training.** 

Now you might ask, why choose 0G?

Decentralizing AI is no small feat. AI workflows are inherently complex, involving enormous data processing and [power consumption](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/06/20/ai-power-consumption-rapidly-becoming-mission-critical/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1726264196273001&usg=AOvVaw3no0yz-PVLcxEjnq-479Zu). 

Today's blockchain infrastructure falls short in meeting the needs of real-world AI applications due to limited throughput: Ethereum processes 10-20 TPS, Solana [less than 4,000 TPS](https://explorer.solana.com/), and Layer 2s [less than 400 TPS](https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity). This equates to data throughput of ~1.5 mbps on average, which is 33,333x lower than the 50+ gbps that's needed to fuel AI applications. 

## 0G has achieved 50 gbps DA throughput per consensus layer.

This is possible by incorporating cutting-edge horizontal scaling and sharding mechanisms to achieve remarkable speed. By distributing AI workloads across a network of specialized nodes, 0G reduces latency and accelerates processing times, making it highly competitive with centralized Web2 AI systems. This efficiency is critical as AI applications scale and require increasingly powerful resources. You can read more about this in the following [section](/intro).

**0G is the first Decentralized  AI [Operating System](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/) (dAIOS),** building the foundation for a better, fairer, and more open AI ecosystem, where power is distributed and innovation thrives. 

In the following sections, we’ll dive deeper into how 0G enables this vision and what it means for the future of AI.
